# We intentionally do NOT mount any data-persistence volume for Firestore.
# The gcloud Firestore emulator (Native mode) is in-memory only and clears data
# on shutdown, so persisting /data would be misleading.
#
# We DO mount the function source for live reload during local dev. Remove that
# bind mount if you prefer image-only, rebuild-on-change workflow.
